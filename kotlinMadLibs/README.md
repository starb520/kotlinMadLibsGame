# Overview

Exposure and practice of multiple programming languages and problems helps to deepen the overall understanding of software development. By learning Kotlin it helps broaden my skill level, but also to deepen it.
This is a Mad Lib game. A user is provided with prompts to provide a variety of parts of speech. The user input will be used to complete a story.
My purpose for writing this program was to gain experience with the Kotlin language. By practicing using variables, loops, and methods I would become acquainted with Kotlin.

# Development Environment

I used YouTube videos, multiples online sites, and my Applied Programming teacher.

I used Kotlin.
# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* I left a lot of commented out code in the program to try and help me remember the different concepts I learned. In the future I would like to retain more of what I learned so, I don't need to reference my comments as much.
* I spent too long trying to troubleshoot opening new projects for Kotlin in IntelliJ.
* I want to take more time to add classes.
